#goaws scratch sheet

Store information


.pem key name and location. Normally found in /home/$user/.ssh Key name will have to be called for and remembered with
persistance

Username for server login eg Ubuntu@ 
Strech goal multi user logins saved??

Ip address, it is assumed that the user will be using aws elastic IP system so this can remain relativly constant however it
should be as easy as possible to change the Ip of an existing server to not create a burdon. Strech goal would be some form of
varification which pings the address automaticly to see if it exists or is visable.

Adding onto the Ip adress list would be updateing the hosts file in /etc/hosts to give each server its name and stream line the
process
